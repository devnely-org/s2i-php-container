PHP Server Container Image For Wordpress
======================================

This repository is a fork from https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-php-container.git.

The original "README.md" ( "repo forked" ) is [README.md](.github/README_ORIGINAL.md)

The repository is part of a project ( "Laboratory Environment for Wordpress")  whose objective  is to create a laboratory environment to work through Openshit 3.11 on a website created with Wordpress. In this repository we create container image mysql database for Wordpress based on Centos7.

This is not a project of collaboration with "sclorg/s2i-php-container", so the master branch used just to keep this repository up to date. For more information about working to repository to see [aqu√≠](.github/WORKFLOW.md).

Versions

PHP versions currently supported are:
* [php-7.2](7.2)

# Getting Started 
>>>>>>> 4d29393... Add information to repository

We create a custom container with s2i-php in centos7 system. For this we use [source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) technology.

We create two branches:
- "main" what is the production
- "develop" which is the development

## Prerequisites
   - Openshift 3.11
   - git
   - github
   - you want
   
# Running the tests
 
 The tests are developed in openshitf and we will not show their development and performance. If we note that we will do individualized tests for each image and a global one with all the images at play (wordpress and mysql).

<<<<<<< HEAD
    $ podman pull centos/php-73-centos7

Note: while the installation steps are calling `podman`, you can replace any such calls by `docker` with the same arguments.

**Notice: By omitting the `VERSIONS` parameter, the build/test action will be performed
on all the supported versions of PHP.**


Usage
---------------------------------
For information about usage of Dockerfile for PHP 7.3,
see [usage documentation](7.3/README.md).

For information about usage of Dockerfile for PHP 7.2,
see [usage documentation](7.2/README.md).

Test
---------------------
This repository also provides a [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) test framework,
which launches tests to check functionality of a simple PHP application built on top of the s2i-php image.

Users can choose between testing a PHP test application based on a RHEL or CentOS image.

*  **RHEL based image**

    This image is not available as a trusted build in [Docker Index](https://index.docker.io).

    To test a RHEL7 based PHP-5.5 image, you need to run the test on a properly
    subscribed RHEL machine.

    ```
    $ cd s2i-php-container
    $ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSIONS=7.3
    ```

*  **CentOS based image**

    ```
    $ cd s2i-php-container
    $ make test TARGET=centos7 VERSIONS=7.3
    ```

**Notice: By omitting the `VERSIONS` parameter, the build/test action will be performed
on all the supported versions of PHP.**

* **`<php-version>`**

    * **Dockerfile**

        CentOS based Dockerfile.

    * **Dockerfile.rhel7**

        RHEL based Dockerfile. In order to perform build or test actions on this
        Dockerfile you need to run the action on properly subscribed RHEL machine.

    * **`s2i/bin/`**

        This folder contains scripts that are run by [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image):

        *   **assemble**

            Used to install the sources into the location where the application
            will be run and prepare the application for deployment (eg. installing
            modules using npm, etc..)

        *   **run**

            This script is responsible for running the application, by using the
            application web server.

        This folder contains a file with commonly used modules.

    * **`test/`**

        This folder contains the [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image)
        test framework with a sample PHP app.

        * **`test-app/`**

            A simple PHP app used for testing purposes by the [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) test framework.
